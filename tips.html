<form>
	<!-- As label elements are inline by default, they are all displayed side by side on the same line, making their text hard to read. To make them appear on separate lines, add display: block to the label element, and add a margin to separate them from each other. -->

	<!-- Following accessibility best practices, the for attribute links the input elements and the label elements together using. -->

	<!-- Specifying the type attribute of a form element is important for the browser to know what kind of data it should expect. If the type is not specified, the browser will default to text -->


	<!-- The first input element with a type of submit is automatically set to submit its nearest parent form element -->

	<!-- Certain type attribute values come with built-in form validation. For example, type="email" requires that the value be a valid email address.

Add custom validation to the password input element, by adding a minlength attribute with a value of 8. Doing so prevents inputs of less than 8 characters being submitted. -->

<!-- With type="password" you can use the pattern attribute to define a regular expression that the password must match to be considered valid.

Add a pattern attribute to the password input element to require the input match: [a-z0-5]{8,} -->

<!-- You only want one radio input to be selectable at a time. However, the form does not know the radio inputs are related.

To relate the radio inputs, give them the same name attribute with a value of account-type. Now, it is not possible to select both radio inputs at the same time. -->


<!-- Adding a dropdown to the form is easy with the select element. The select element is a container for a group of option elements, and the option element acts as a label for each dropdown option. Both elements require closing tags. -->

<!-- Submitting the form with an option selected would not send a useful value to the server. As such, each option needs to be given a value attribute. Without which, the text content of the option will be submitted to the server. -->

<!-- The textarea element acts like an input element of type text, but comes with the added benefit of being able to receive multi-line text, and an initial number of text rows and columns. -->


<!-- The textarea appears too small. To give it an initial size, you can add the rows and cols attributes.

Add an initial size of 3 rows and 30 columns. -->

<!-- With form submissions, it is useful, and good practice, to provide each submittable element with a name attribute. This attribute is used to identify the element in the form submission. -->

<!-- 
The border of the last fieldset element looks a little out of place. You can select the last element of a specific type using the last-of-type CSS pseudo-class, like this:

p:last-of-type { } -->

<!-- To style the submit button, you can use an attribute selector, which selects an element based on the given attribute value. Here is an example:

input[name="password"] -->
</form>
