	<!-- As label elements are inline by default, they are all displayed side by side on the same line, making their text hard to read. To make them appear on separate lines, add display: block to the label element, and add a margin to separate them from each other. -->

	<!-- Following accessibility best practices, the for attribute links the input elements and the label elements together using. -->

	<!-- Specifying the type attribute of a form element is important for the browser to know what kind of data it should expect. If the type is not specified, the browser will default to text -->


	<!-- The first input element with a type of submit is automatically set to submit its nearest parent form element -->

	<!-- Certain type attribute values come with built-in form validation. For example, type="email" requires that the value be a valid email address.

Add custom validation to the password input element, by adding a minlength attribute with a value of 8. Doing so prevents inputs of less than 8 characters being submitted. -->

<!-- With type="password" you can use the pattern attribute to define a regular expression that the password must match to be considered valid.

Add a pattern attribute to the password input element to require the input match: [a-z0-5]{8,} -->

<!-- You only want one radio input to be selectable at a time. However, the form does not know the radio inputs are related.

To relate the radio inputs, give them the same name attribute with a value of account-type. Now, it is not possible to select both radio inputs at the same time. -->


<!-- Adding a dropdown to the form is easy with the select element. The select element is a container for a group of option elements, and the option element acts as a label for each dropdown option. Both elements require closing tags. -->
